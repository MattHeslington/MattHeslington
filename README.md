<h1>Hello. Thanks for visiting</h1>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a fullstack developer who adores working with React. When I'm not working on a project, I'm learing a new technique or skill (e.g. at the moment I'm learning FaunaDB as I've read it's a big improvement on Firebase) or playing with one of my two or three side-projects I usually have on the go as well. I'm currently working on a Desktop/Mobile journalling style app which curiously looks very similar to Facebook when in dark mode. After I've completed the mobile app I want to start working on an Airbnb clone, which at the moment I envisage building using NextJS with FaunaDB for the backend. I'm yet to find a snippets manager app I like, so building one of these is another side project.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once had the role of the main character in an Indonesian soap opera
